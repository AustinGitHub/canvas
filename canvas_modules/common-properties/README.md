## Common Properties API
_[TBD]_

The `Common Properties` editor can be used to easily surface sophisticated property editors. Driven by _Flow JSON_ (https://ibm.ent.box.com/folder/17889566513), the Properties editor supports tabs, grouping, and other UI hints that allow the definition of complex UIs via simple JSON documents.

### Functions
```
editProperties() - Invoke with an instance of Flow JSON to show an editing dialog
  with the provided properties arranged in appropriate UI controls. This is a synchronous
  call that returns an updated Flow JSON instance, or null when
```

### Events
(none)
